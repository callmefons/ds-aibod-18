### Project Overview
Using R and Machine Learning to analyze electric power demand by circuit data from Miyama City in Fukuoka, Japan, and to build models to predict electric power consumption.
The series will be comprised of two different articles describing the major aspects of a Machine Learning project. The topics to be covered are:

* **[Data analysis](miyama_analysis.html) **
* **[Linear regression model](miyama_linear_model.html) **
* **[Random Forest Regression Model](miyama_tree_model.html) **
